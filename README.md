# Rockbuster Stealth LLC Data Analysis

## Introduction
Welcome to the Rockbuster Stealth LLC Data Analysis Repository! In this project, we dive into the world of data to support Rockbuster Stealth's transition to an online video rental service. In the face of fierce competition from streaming giants, such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, our mission is to harness the power of Rockbuster's extensive movie licenses through insightful data analysis.

## Project Overview
As a data analyst within the Business Intelligence (BI) department, our primary objective is to develop a robust launch strategy. The initial step involves loading Rockbuster's data into a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) and utilizing SQL for comprehensive analysis. This analysis will not only assist the BI department but will also cater to the data-related queries of various departments, ranging from inventory management to customer insights.

## Key Questions and Objectives
The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has outlined crucial business questions for the 2020 company strategy, and our analysis aims to provide data-driven answers. The results will be compiled into an easily digestible format for presentation to the Management Board. Here are the key questions guiding our analysis:

1. **Revenue Contribution by Movies:**
   - Identify movies that significantly contributed to both the highest and lowest revenue gains.

2. **Average Rental Duration:**
   - Determine the average rental duration for all videos to understand user viewing habits.

3. **Customer Locations:**
   - Explore the countries where Rockbuster customers are predominantly based.

4. **High Lifetime Value Customers:**
   - Identify the geographical locations of customers with a high lifetime value.

5. **Regional Sales Variations:**
   - Investigate if sales figures exhibit variations across different geographic regions.
