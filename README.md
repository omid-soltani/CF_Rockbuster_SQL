# Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project

## Introduction
Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a former global movie rental giant, faced fierce competition from streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime. In response, the management devised a strategic move – launching an online video rental service using existing movie licenses.

## Objective 
In this project, I played a pivotal role in the Rockbuster Stealth Business Intelligence (BI) department. 
As the data analyst spearheading this initiative, I navigated through the intricate world of movie rentals.

The mission? Craft a solid launch strategy for the new online video service. 
From loading Rockbuster's data into an RDBMS to employing SQL for ad-hoc analyses, each step contributed to actionable insights.

The outcome? A concise presentation, ready to be shared with the Rockbuster Stealth Management Board, encapsulating the data-driven decisions shaping the company's foray into the online video rental market.
